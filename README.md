# myWatchList

a web/mobile application for anime-lovers who want to learn more about the current top 25 anime shows.

### AJAX-project

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project using REST API.

I am an avid binge-watcher of all kinds of shows. However, I understand the struggle of sifting through endless recommendations and feeling overwhelmed. Information overload is real. I spend a good amount of time browsing the app to find the best one and eventually get drained and overwhelmed from the decision making. In order to minimize this issue, I created a simple web/mobile-friendly application for anime lovers who want to see the current top 25 most popular anime and get more information about them. You can discover your new favorite anime in just a few clicks!
